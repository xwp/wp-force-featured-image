Ever wanted to force a user to publish a post with a featured image of a certain dimension? Search no more.

== Description ==

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/wajiharizvi001/wpf-force-featured-image). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/wajiharizvi001/wpf-force-featured-image/issues) reported there before going to the plugin forum.**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wpf-force-featured-image` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. This plugin lets you specify which post-type requires to force a featured image to. It will also let you specify minimum dimensions for the image.
Let's say, for example, you want to force a user to set an image on the default post type with the following dimensions (400px * 400px). Put this code in the function.php of your theme :

`
	function theme_wpf_force_featured_image( $options ){
		$options['post'] = array(
			'width'  => 400,
			'height' => 400,
		);

		return $options;
	}
	add_filter( 'wpf_force_featured_image_post_type', 'theme_force_featured_image' );
`

== Screenshots ==
